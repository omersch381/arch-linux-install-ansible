Some tasks I consider a must:
* Add zsh & oh-my-zsh installation to user, as currently the user's shells defined to be zsh but zsh is not installed
* Replace all module names with namespace.package.module 
* Test the crontab job on a real machine (not a container - WSL problems)
* Test the playbook when run with regular user (not root).
* Add to README the `curl -LOJ shorturl.at/cgwHQ` option
* Make all the tasks which require variables optional (using when)


Some tasks I consider as nice to have:
* Allow users to decide how they want their partitions (let them design the partitions rather than deciding for them to have the partitions as I do)
* Add an ansible cron module to create a job to update in a certain frequency the dotfiles git.
