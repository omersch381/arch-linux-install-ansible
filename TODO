Some tasks I consider a must:
* Replace all module names with namespace.package.module 
* Add to README the `curl -LOJ shorturl.at/cgwHQ` option
* Add to README `bsdtar xvf archive.zip`

Some tasks I consider as nice to have:
* Allow users to decide how they want their partitions (let them design the partitions rather than deciding for them to have the partitions as I do)
