Some tasks I consider a must:
* Replace all module names with namespace.package.module 
* Replace ansible-playbook with ansible-navigator run. 

Some tasks I consider as nice to have:
* Allow users to decide how they want their partitions (let them design the partitions rather than deciding for them to have the partitions as I do)
