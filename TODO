Some tasks I consider a must:
* Take care of the dotfiles role
* Add zsh & oh-my-zsh installation to user, as currently the user's shells defined to be zsh but zsh is not installed


Some tasks I consider as nice to have:
* Allow users to decide how they want their partitions (let them design the partitions rather than deciding for them to have the partitions as I do)
* Add an ansible cron module to create a job to update in a certain frequency the dotfiles git.
